<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Block and Bleed Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Bore</li><li>Reduced Bore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Double Block and Bleed (DBB) valve market includes two main types: Full Bore and Reduced Bore. Full Bore valves allow for uninterrupted flow and minimal pressure drop, making them ideal for high-flow applications. In contrast, Reduced Bore valves feature a smaller internal diameter, which can create more resistance and lower flow rates, but they are often more compact and cost-effective. Both types serve critical roles in isolating sections of piping systems while ensuring safe venting of trapped fluids.</p></p>
