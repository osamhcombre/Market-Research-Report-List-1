<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Optics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fibre</li><li>Single-mode Fibre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optics market is primarily divided into two types: multimode fiber and single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber features a larger core diameter, allowing multiple light modes to propagate simultaneously, making it ideal for short-distance communication, such as within buildings. In contrast, single-mode fiber has a smaller core that permits only one light mode, providing higher bandwidth and longer distances, thus suitable for telecommunications and long-range data transmission. These distinctions drive their applications in various sectors, including networking and data centers.</p></p>
