<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Injectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Port Injector</li><li>Single-Port Injector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air injectors market is primarily divided into two types: multi-port injectors and single-port injectors. Multi-port injectors supply air directly to each cylinder, enhancing combustion efficiency and reducing emissions. They offer better performance and fuel economy, making them popular in modern vehicles. In contrast, single-port injectors introduce air into a single intake port for multiple cylinders, simplifying design and reducing costs, but may offer less performance optimization. Both types are essential in meeting evolving automotive emission standards and performance requirements.</p></p>
